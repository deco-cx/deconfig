# Dynamic edge configuration management

`deconfig` is an **edge-native** deno configuration management framework for building fast and personalized edge applications that can be dynamically configured at runtime without a redeploy.

Applications developers integrate `deconfig` to allow business users to change the configuration of distributed edge systems safely, with full auditability and rollback capability.

`deconfig` allows configuration to be distributed in a precise and deliberate fashion by giving developers granular, function-based control over which configuration is active for any given request.

Developers define `matcher functions` to determine which configuration is active for a given request, and an `effect function` to determine the value of a configuration variable for a given request upon activation.

Once all available configuration for this site is matched, the application can use the final configuration values to determine and run the business logic for the request, be it rendering an HTML response generated by a [fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) app, executing a [durable](https://github.com/deco-cx/durable) workflow, or any other custom-defined, deno-powered behavior.

## Use cases

There are multiple use cases for `deconfig`, for example:

- **Acess token and secret management**

  - `deconfig` allows developers to distribute access tokens and secrets to running deno applications without exposing them in source code, while allowing for different tokens to be used in different environments.

- **Personalization and A/B testing**

  - `deconfig` allows developers to use configuration to personalize the experience for each user, and measure the impact of each version on user behaviour by tracking the active configurations for each request.

- **Configuration as code**

  - `deconfig` allows developers to express strongly-typed schemas for their application configuration and leverage a rich set of tools to manage and deploy configuration changes.

## Self-hosting

We are working to make the `deconfig` service available as a self-contained docker image for self-hosting by Q2 2023. In the meantime, you can use our hosted version at [deco.cx](https://deco.cx).

## The deco.cx platform

`deconfig` is part of the `deco.cx` platform, which is a set of tools and services that allow developers to build and deploy edge-native, high-performance commerce experiences. All deco.cx sites are built with `deconfig`, so you can use it in production today. Our free plan is perfect for small projects.
